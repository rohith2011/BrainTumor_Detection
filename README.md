# BrainTumor_Detection
• Developed a standalone application with up to 90% accuracy in detecting brain tumors, utilizing Tkinter.
• Performed prepossessing by eliminating the noisy data and increasing the prediction accuracy by 20%
• Implemented significant improvements in reducing prediction time by around 30% using CNN networks
• Developed a feature for outliner and to mark tumor regions in brain scans for facilitation of easy
identification.
